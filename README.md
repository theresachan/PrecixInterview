# Top K Frequent Elements Finder
Overview
This script provides a function to find the k most frequent elements in an integer array. The solution is efficient and works well even for large input sizes. The function returns the elements in any order.

Requirements
Python 3.x
collections module (for Counter)
heapq module (for extracting the top k frequent elements)

## How It Works
Frequency Calculation: The function first calculates how often each element appears in the array using Python's Counter from the collections module.
Finding the Most Frequent Elements: Using the heapq.nlargest method, the function retrieves the k elements that occur most frequently. This method is efficient and leverages a heap data structure to find the solution.
